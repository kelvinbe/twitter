    ShakesSpear: `William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language 
              and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national 
              poet and the "Bard of Avon"(or simply "the Bard").His extant works, including 
              collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses,
                some of uncertain authorship.His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often 
              than those of any other playwright.
